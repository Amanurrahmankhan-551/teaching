We often see the "./" before the name of an executable file.

The "./" means that we are in the same directory as that executable file.

Before executing a file that is not in a directory specified by your PATH variable, Linux requires you to specify the FULL NAME of the file (i.e., including the directory in which the executable file can be found).

This is convention, but it also serves as a kind of security. Because ordinary users won't be able to play tricks (or worse) by creating executables with the same names as Linux commands.
