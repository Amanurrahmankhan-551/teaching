-----------------
to see the stack (w/ pointer implementation) example code:

https://github.com/takiszourntos/teaching/tree/master/lambton/2020/summer/ese2025/week_4/workspace

I wrote a stack *libary* ---> stack.h and stack.c

now, if someone wants to use my stack implementation, all they have to do is have this line in their program:

#include "stack.h"

(not possible with global variable version!!!)

major components of a library:

queue.h : header file ----> should go in the local (project) include/ folder
 - typedefs 
 - macros (#define)
 - function prototypes

queue.c : source file -----> should go in the local (project) source/ folder
 - #include "queue.h"
 - function definitions (full code)

---> in Settings be sure to specify that your "include/" workspace sub-directory be listed as an include directories
