-----------------
about the index/offset in the stack program:

-> size_t is basically unsigned long

-> to accommodate the -1 value for s_top, it's type had to change from size_t to simply "long"

practical application for stacks and queues in embedded systems is often for Data Buffering

sizeof() is an operator that is a compile-time function: two arguments are possible (an array pointer or a type)
---> the number of bytes associated with a type VARY with platforms

EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS are macros defined in the stdlib library (#include <stdlib.h>)...

use F3 (hover or click on these identifiers)

#define EXIT_FAILURE 1
#define EXIT_SUCCESS 0

... often use in conjuntion with the exit() function, which provides a form of error control
using these instead of just "-1", or "1" or "0" communicates more about the intention of the programmer
