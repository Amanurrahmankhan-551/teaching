Software Environment for the Class... 

We have two main platforms we are going to use. One is the 64-bit host machine (running Eclipse under Linux) and the other is an MCU environment (Linux on the Beaglebone).

At a minimum, you will need:

1) Ubuntu (18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS) installed on your host machine (laptop or desktop)

2) Eclipse (for C/C++ developers) on your host machine

3) Beaglebone running the latest IoT Debian distribution (available from beagleboard.org)
