-----------------
for those of you without the experience in Signals & Systems, I recommend the following text:

Signals & Systems, Second Edition by Alan V. Oppenheim, Alan S. Willsky with S. Hamid Nawab

get through Chapters 1, 2 and 3 over the next month.

to follow along, if you don't have Octave or Matlab at the moment, do a:

$ sudo apt install octave

(should be possible to install Octave on Windows as well)
