The following circuit
\begin{center}
  \psfrag{x(t)=v(t)}{$x(t)=v(t)$}
  \psfrag{y(t)=v_c(t)}{$y(t)=v_c(t)$}
  \includegraphics{qsystf2_fig1}
\end{center}
is governed by the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  C \frac{dv_c(t)}{dt} = \frac{v(t) - v_c(t)}{R}
\end{equation*}
(by now you should be able to confirm this).  Suppose that for
some application we want to take $x(t) = v(t)$ as input and
$y(t) = v_c(t)$ as output, then the input-output relation is
\begin{equation*}
  C \frac{dy(t)}{dt} = \frac{x(t) - y(t)}{R}.
\end{equation*}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the frequency response of the system and plot its
magnitude and phase. \newline

{\it You need to know that the frequency response is given by
$H(\omega)=Y(\omega)/X(\omega)$, and can be found by taking
Fourier transforms of the input-output relation above and
manipulating. The plots of magnitude ($|H(\omega)|$, or sometimes
$20 \log_{10} |H(\omega)|$) and phase ($\angle H(\omega)$) are
called the {\bf Bode plot} of the system.  For this question you
should see that the system passes low frequencies, but that the
magnitude response falls off at high frequencies --- this is a
simple {\bf lowpass filter}.} \newline

\item Find the impulse response of the system. \newline

{\it The frequency response of the system (also called the
transfer function of the system) is given by the Fourier transform
of the impulse response, so $H(\omega) = {\cal F} \left\{ h(t)
\right\}$.  Thus the impulse response can be found by taking the
inverse Fourier transform of the impulse response:  $h(t) = {\cal
F}^{-1} \left\{ H(\omega) \right\}$.} \newline

\end{enumerate}

{\it Important extension:  repeat the question, but swap the
resistor and the capacitor in the circuit and take the output to
be the voltage across the resistor $y(t) = v_r(t)$ instead.  You
should find that the system obeys the equation
\begin{equation*}
  C \left( \frac{dx(t)}{dt} - \frac{dy(t)}{dt} \right) =
  \frac{1}{R} y(t),
\end{equation*}
and the Bode plot will show you that the system is a {\bf
highpass} filter.}
