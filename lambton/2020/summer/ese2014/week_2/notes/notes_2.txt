So there is no confusion:

For Lab 1: individual submission, start with an empty file/mind/document/screen (in other words, don't start with my code or your friend's code and then try to make minor changes!)

Also, for the report: adhere to the guidelines discussed at the beginning of today's class

Your document body should be largely written in complete sentences. Have something to say, and use code fragments to support your points. 

Save the listings for the Appendix

You can take an extra week or two if you need it
