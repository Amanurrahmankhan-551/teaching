Report Writing

- you have to have something to say, PICK SOMETHING
- potentially wide audience, some non-technical people
- in your introduction, you have to motivate your work and explain its relevance to a larger context --- relate your technial work to a bigger picture
- after the introduction, you can start a DISCUSSION
- in that discussion, use code fragments to illustrate your points
- remember, you have something to say, so presumably you have points to make
- then conclude (reiterate your main points, summarize & justify)
- Appendix: put your code listings back here for people who may be interested in looking at them
