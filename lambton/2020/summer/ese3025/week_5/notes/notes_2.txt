YOU CAN GET A MAKEFILE FOR YOUR PROJECT JUST BY MAKING SUBSTITUTIONS IN MY MAKEFILE, WHICH I HAVE STARTED FOR YOU HERE:

# suppressing errors in recipes. 
#
# author: T. Zourntos, emad studio
#

# define a variable to contain all of our object files (if this list changes, we only need to change the variable)
objects = gol.o cells.o display.o

# define a variable for our include directory
include = includes

# specify a search path for all prerequisites; looks for .o, .c or .h files in ./ or source/ or my_includes/
VPATH = source:includes

# provide a parameter for our implicit compilation rule (for gcc)
CFLAGS = -I$(include)

# our project will be called proj_pthreads and it LINKS object files gol.o, cells.o and display.o
proj_pthreads : $(objects)
 gcc -o proj_pthreads $(objects) -lpthread -lncurses

# compile gol.c to produce gol.o, if needed
gol.o : gols.c cells.h display.h

# compile lib_ll.c, if needed
lib_ll.o : lib_ll.c lib_ll.h

# compile lib_bst.c, if needed
lib_bst.o : lib_bst.c lib_bst.h

# a clean option that will remove proj_ds and any object files, with EXTRA features now!
.PHONY : clean # declaring clean as "phony" prevents it from being ignored if a file named "clean" happens to exist in the directory!
clean :
 -rm proj_ds $(objects)
# ^
# |_______ with the "-" in front of rm, the rm command will continue to execute in spite of any errors generated (such as "file does not exist")
