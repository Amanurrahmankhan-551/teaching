 * update cell located at row r and column c in env (indicated by X):
 *
 * a b c
 * d X e
 * f g h
 *
 * with nearest neighbours indicated as shown from a, b, ..., h.
 *
 * this function features Conway's rules:
 * - if a cell is dead but surrounded by exactly three live neighbours, it sprouts to life (birth)
 * - if a cell is live but has more than 4 live neighbours, it dies (overpopulation)
 * - if a cell is live but has fewer than 2 live neighbours, it dies (underpopulation)
 * - all other dead or live cells remain the same to the next generation (i.e., a live cell must
 * have exactly three neighbours to survive)

// only interested in when the cell state changes
if (cell == dead) && (live_neighbours==3)
{
 cell = live;
}
if (cell == live) && ( (live_neighbours > 4) || (live_neighbours < 2) )
{
 cell = dead;
}

To check against the result in my video:

- communities are going to be 16 x 16 
- for the environment, 8 communities across by 2 communities down (16 pthreads)
