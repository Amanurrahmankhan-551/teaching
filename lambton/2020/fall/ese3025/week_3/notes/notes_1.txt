Some resources for getting into Conway's Game of Life

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

check out the examples of patterns, in particular

more legit reference (non-Wikipedia!) from an article published in Scientific American:

Please note John Conway's desiderata from the article:
"The basic idea is to start with a simple configuration of counters (organisms), one to a cell, then observe
how it changes as you apply Conway's "genetic laws" for births, deaths, and survivals. Conway chose his
rules carefully, after a long period of experimentation, to meet three desiderata:
1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit.
2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.
3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to end in three possible ways: fading away
 completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase 
 in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods. In brief, the rules should be such as to make the behavior of the population unpredictable."
