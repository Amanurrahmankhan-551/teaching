### Images, Video and Audio (Chapter 14, pg. 643 of Exploring Beaglebone, 2nd Edition)


## USB Webcam
- use a USB hub since the Beaglebone has only a single USB2.0 port
- and you might need to connect a mouse, keyboard and a camera

- for this tutorial, please use your GUI version of Debian Linux on the Beaglebone Black (or Pocket Beagle)
- recommended: connect the Beaglebone to an external power supply especially when you are using many USB peripherals!

- connect your camera, boot the Beaglebone and try this:

$ lsusb # lists the devices connected to your system via USB


- to inspect any associated loadable kernel modules, try the following:

$ lsmod # lists the drivers associated with your devices

- "uncvideo" is what you're looking for: this module works with USB-based cameras

# Simple Image Capture (pg. 647)

$ sudo apt update # prepare for installation

$ apt-cache search v4l2

$ sudo apt install fswebcam gpicview libav-tools libv4l-dev

now, be sure to take Derek's fswebcom.conf file and sftp it to your Beaglebone, or you can directly clone exploringBB/ using git onto your Beaglebone Black.

$ sudo fswebcam -c fswebcam.conf

you can also try to get a "video feed" on the Beaglebone:

$ sudo apt install cheese



N.B.: if you are using a USB hub, it should be powered in order for most USB cameras to work properly, otherwise you may not get an image! You may also get some error messages.
